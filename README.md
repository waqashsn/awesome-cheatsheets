## 🎩 Why Awesome-Cheatsheets?

I always make a cheatsheet when I want to improve my skills on a programming language, a framework or a development tool. [I started doing these kind of things a long time ago on Gist](https://gist.github.com/LeCoupa) To better keep track of the history and to let people contribute to them, I reorganized everything into this  single repository. Most of the content is coming from official documentations and some books I have read.

Feel free to browse each cheatsheet to learn new things and to keep them at hand when you forgot about one command. They have been designed to provide a quick way to assess your knowledge and to save you time.
